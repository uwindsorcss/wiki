In my case, one of those impromptu discoveries ended up deciding my major and entire career path \u2013 and so far? I don\u2019t regret it (except, admittedly, the Calculus parts).\\n\\nSo, without further ado\u2026here\u2019s the tale of the time I, formerly a complete beginner to anything and everything Computer Science, found one little YouTube video\u2026and the rest is history.\\n\\nI was relaxing over March Break and, as usual, fell straight down the YouTube rabbit hole of recommendations (that never fail to be eerily accurate, and extremely tempting to boot). In doing so, I came across this innocuous little video titled \u201CMake Windows Look Better\u201D by Urim Bersha.\\n\\nTired of the outdated UI of Windows 8 that I had on my old laptop, and being the notorious aesthete that I am, I clicked \u2013 intrigued by the sleek, city night themed desktop it promised. After watching, the beautiful theme and the easy, foolproof instructions enticed me, and I downloaded a computer program called Rainmeter, intent on following his instructions to a T.\\n\\nExcept - I did not. My imagination got the best of me, and soon I was envisioning not just a city, but a pixelated pastel paradise perfectly suited to my taste. What was originally intended to be a few hours of applying the tried-and-true steps to my computer ended up being a full 3-day adventure into the previously untravelled world of coding. I was so intrigued by what the program could do when editing the source code of sample objects and using the (...mostly) informative words of forums like Reddit as my guide, I set to work building my pastel paradise.\\n\\nThrough this unexpected little foray, I was able to get a grasp on C++ and Lua, and despite my rudimentary knowledge based completely on internet forum advice and messing around with the code until something stuck, I was able to begin to construct it. Even though it was not easy, I was so enthralled by it that none of it felt like a chore, and I was having genuine fun solving the problems I encountered along the way. After 72 hours (about 3 days) of toiling away behind my screen, with the odd food or bathroom breaks (sleep was, admittedly, a tad compromised), my peachy pixel paradise was complete, and I felt so incredibly satisfied. Borne out of all the errors, glitches, and missing files (that I had to scramble to find and label) was this custom theme I built, and it looked amazing.\\n\\nNot only did I come out of that experience with a sweet desktop theme, but a newfound interest and passion for the intricacies of computers, which eventually led me to where I am today! That, I am and will be forever grateful for.\\n\\nNowadays, I\u2019ve continued on my personal mission to customize everything I use, including my Discord, Spotify, VSCode, phone screen, browser window\u2026you name it, I will find a way to slap my favourite colours on it somehow. I plan to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript soon to turn my customization cravings into actual skills that will contribute towards my dream of being a front-end software engineer! It is crazy to think that I would have never even considered this career path if it weren\u2019t for that one video, so life-changing opportunities can truly be found in the strangest of ways, so always keep an eye out\u2026yes, even for a YouTube video."},{"id":"/2022/04/02/coding-conventions","metadata":{"permalink":"/wiki/newsletter/2022/04/02/coding-conventions","editUrl":"https://github.com/UWindsorCSS/Wiki/tree/master/newsletter/2022-04-02-coding-conventions.md","source":"@site/newsletter/2022-04-02-coding-conventions.md","title":"Coding Convention Tips to Keep Track of","description":"Nothing quite kills the joy in programming like silly mistakes do \u2013 be it a missing semicolon or faulty logic planning.

Every programmer has a variation of their own modus operandi, but a programmer worth their salt will tend to have these following tricks well-embedded into their programs:\\n\\n**Concise Commenting**\\n\\nEveryone knows commenting is a must. You would lose marks on your labs if you left your program especially ambiguous, right? But the importance of proper commenting stems past these labs \u2013 well-structured comments show their true potential when working on more long-term projects. If you took a break for a week off your computer, would you still remember exactly what every function on your program does? Unless the answer is \u201Cyes\u201D, commenting remains a very valuable tool to keep the apt programmer in the know.\\n\\n**Ideal Indenting**\\n\\nMuch like commenting, the concept of indents has most likely been hammered into your head since high school. But, in case you haven\u2019t already heard of it, proper indentation is one of the most important techniques you can employ in your coding style. This is because it can drastically improve readability to humans, which may not only be you. If you want your TAs to have an easier time grading your work, make sure they can tell when your loops begin and end!\\n\\n**Variable Titles and Terming**\\n\\nLast, but not least: naming your variables and functions. Naming your variables unsuitably may not disadvantage the computer in any way, but it\u2019ll certainly give your TA a reasonable basis to cross out some free marks on your final product. When creating a new variable or function, try not to resort to overly short or lengthy names. Name it appropriately to its functionality without going overboard with the description. Of course, exceptions exist: \u201Ci\u201D and \u201Cj\u201D are considered good style if your program only has a few loops. Proper naming comes with practice and intuition!"},{"id":"/2022/04/01/bowling","metadata":{"permalink":"/wiki/newsletter/2022/04/01/bowling","editUrl":"https://github.com/UWindsorCSS/Wiki/tree/master/newsletter/2022-04-01-bowling.md","source":"@site/newsletter/2022-04-01-bowling.md","title":"Fun Time at the CSS Super Bowl!","description":"On Friday, April 8th, the Computer Science Society hosted a CSS Bowling night with 40 attendees.

After the semester ended, over winter break, I began working on a game that I had an idea for a year prior. After about a month and a half, I had a simple game which I called [Dungeon Rollers](https://amethystramstudios.itch.io/dungeon-rollers). The game is a dungeon crawler where you battle enemies by rolling dice. My game had no animations, one looping song and was just generally clunky and rough around the edges. With this game, I experienced first-hand what I always hear from established game developers. Don\u2019t spend long on any of your early projects. I had learned so much in the short time that I was working on Dungeon Rollers that to move forward in development I would have to completely redo most of the groundwork that was in place, essentially starting from scratch! Although the game was not what I had originally envisioned, I still consider it to be a great success and it was an amazing experience. On top of learning so much from development, a Twitch streamer that I watched named Dan Gheesling [played it on his show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAZ8LCqP7eY) and brought fresh eyes to my game (a few hundred people watching live and over 2000 watched the YouTube video after), which led to 701 page views, 358 browser plays, and 41 downloads at the time that I\u2019m writing this article.\\n\\nAfter releasing my first game, I was eager to keep developing. But this time, I focused on small projects to hone my skills. I ended up creating 2 more very small games through some game jams that I entered online and although the gameplay for those games isn\u2019t the most riveting, I learned so much from them such as how to set up animations as well as how to better handle user input. The things that I learned in these simple games are still things that I use to this day in my development!\\n\\nAfter finishing the development on those games, I decided that I wanted to come back to Dungeon Rollers and make it more like the game I had always envisioned. I started working on the remastered version (which I had renamed to Battle Rollers as there was another game with the name Dungeon Rollers and I didn\u2019t want to cause any confusion). Development ran from the end of April to the beginning of June. Battle Rollers has 2 playable characters, 4 original songs for different areas, and 6 enemy types with unique behaviours! I was so happy with my game and what I had accomplished, and I thought that I would try something new and [release it on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1653860/Battle_Rollers/).\\n\\nFor those that don\u2019t know how releasing games on Steam works, just like I didn\u2019t, there are a couple important things to know. Valve charges a $130 CAD fee for releasing a game on Steam and they take a 30% cut of any sales of your game, if you are selling it that is. With those things in mind, I went forward and released my game on Steam and have been very happy with the experience! While I haven\u2019t yet sold enough copies to break even on the Steam Direct Fee, it\u2019s a crazy feeling to know that anyone, anywhere, can open Steam on their computer and see my game. An even crazier feeling is seeing people from around the world buying my game. At the time of writing this, I have sold copies of my game in the UK, Germany, Russia, and South Korea! I\u2019ve sold a total of 17 copies, with over 160 users keeping it on their Wishlist. At the end of the day, having this experience was amazing and I\u2019m so glad I did it!\\n\\nHopefully I\u2019ve inspired some of you to pursue game development in your future and I hope that you enjoyed reading my story! If there\u2019s one thing that you should learn from this article, it\u2019s to just develop your game. It won\u2019t be perfect out of the gate and that\u2019s totally okay! It doesn\u2019t need to be.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about game development, or my game, then get in touch with me!

Sometimes there\u2019s a theme or a specific challenge, and other times it\u2019s more open to interpretation. The reason why I always recommend hackathons to students is because they\u2019re free, fun, and incredibly helpful in learning new skills. From attending workshops about new tech, to receiving advice from mentors, to connecting with your teammates, there are a TON of ways to learn new stuff at hackathons!\\n\\nOne of the cool things about hackathons is you can potentially use a hackathon in three different parts on your resume: you can list the project you built under \u201Cprojects\u201D, the hackathon itself under \u201Ccompetitions\u201D, and any prizes you won under \u201Cawards\u201D. Since MLH has hackathons every weekend, within the span of a month you can go from nothing on your resume to multiple projects and competitions!\\n\\nHave I piqued your interest? Well, you\u2019re in luck. The University of Windsor has its own hackathon - WinHacks! WinHacks will take place from March 25-27, and there will be plenty of workshops, events, and opportunities to win money! I urge everyone to [apply for the hackathon here](http://apply.winhacks.ca/). Also to participate, you must [join our Discord server](http://discord.winhacks.ca/). I look forward to seeing you all there!"},{"id":"/2022/02/04/synthetic-data","metadata":{"permalink":"/wiki/newsletter/2022/02/04/synthetic-data","editUrl":"https://github.com/UWindsorCSS/Wiki/tree/master/newsletter/2022-02-04-synthetic-data.md","source":"@site/newsletter/2022-02-04-synthetic-data.md","title":"Using Synthetic Data to Improve Machine Learning","description":"Artificial intelligence is becoming an increasingly prominent field of computer science.

The idea of computers being able to think for themselves is both amazing and is what motivates me to learn more about programming.\\n\\nThere is only one drawback to AI (Artificial Intelligence): data is needed for the model to learn and mature. A lot of data in fact, especially for sophisticated models. For example, Inception V3 (a model for image classification developed from Google) requires over a million datapoints for training.\\n\\nThat is a lot of data! Collecting the data can be expensive and incredibly time consuming. If only it were possible to generate your own data instead of having to collect it organically.\\n\\nThat is where synthetic data comes in. Synthetic data can solve lots of problems regarding AI. For one thing, it allows developers to work with more data without having to overcome various obstacles they may face. Some of these obstacles include the cost of collecting information, as well as potential privacy concerns.\\n\\nIt also will preserve relationships between variables in a model, as the data will be created intelligently instead of randomly. Not only that, but synthetic data can simulate conditions not yet encountered in your organic dataset. This can be highly beneficial for the health industry, robotics, security and other areas.\\n\\nNow of course, any synthetic models generating data from already existing models can only go so far. They can only simulate general trends and reproduce specific properties derived from their organic counterparts. Though, [a study at MIT in 2017](https://news.mit.edu/2017/artificial-data-give-same-results-as-real-data-0303) showed that training a model from real versus artificial data showed no significant performance difference 70% of the time.\\n\\nSynthetic data is a growing reality in the field of artificial intelligence. As developers discover new and improved ways to generate data, we will see an increasing amount of synthetic data in various machine learning applications.\\n\\nI hope this excites you as much as it excites me!"},{"id":"/2022/02/03/open-data","metadata":{"permalink":"/wiki/newsletter/2022/02/03/open-data","editUrl":"https://github.com/UWindsorCSS/Wiki/tree/master/newsletter/2022-02-03-open-data.md","source":"@site/newsletter/2022-02-03-open-data.md","title":"Introduction to Open Data","description":"Imagine you have an idea for a piece of software.

The rest is handled by the UWindsor Open Data API.\\n\\nOpen Data or an Open Data Initiative (or Policy) is a service that a group provides that gives their data as data sets or an API to be easily accessible by the public.\\n\\nRight about now, you may be asking, \u201CWhy do I care? What does it mean for me?\u201D That is a particularly good question. Open Data lets us create tools that we have not even thought of yet.\\n\\nThe University of Waterloo has an Open Data Initiative, and they have a tremendous number of apps made by students. The point is empowering students to create exactly what they want, how they want, with amazing tools.\\n\\nDo you want an Open Data Initiative at the University of Windsor? CSS agrees!
