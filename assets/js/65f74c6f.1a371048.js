That being said, overloading added a lot of additional work for me and made these last two semesters harder than they could have been. For some context, I overloaded the semester when I took COMP-4540 and COMP-4400, as well as other core courses, and it certainly was not easy. I did, however, survive and got to graduate sooner as a result. I would recommend anyone who considers overloading to craft their overloaded semesters in a way such that you have at least one bird course.
