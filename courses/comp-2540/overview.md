## Course Title

The title for COMP-2540 is "Data Structures and Algorithms".

## Course Description

An introduction to the programming and analysis of linear and non-linear internal (main store) data structures and associated algorithms . Topics include the formal notion of an algorithm, elementary time and space complexity; linear lists (such as stacks, queues, linked structures.); non-linear lists (trees, binary trees); recursion; sorting techniques (such as heap sort, quick sort, merge sort, shell sort.); searching techniques (such as binary search, binary search trees, red-black trees, hashing.); algorithm design paradigms (such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms); and applications. (Prerequisite: COMP-1000 and COMP-1410.) (3 lecture hours and 1.5 laboratory hours a week.)
