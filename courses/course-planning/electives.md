Most CS programs require students to take some Arts/Languages/Social Science classes. The Honours Computer Science program, for example, requires three of such courses (at least one in Arts/Languages and one in Social Science).

**The bolded courses are considered to be bird courses by other CSS members who have taken them.**

:::warning

This list gives you an overview about classes that you may want to take to satisfy your requirements. However, you should consult an advisor first or look at your [UWinsite Students page](/wiki/resources/guides/uwinsite-guide#academic-progress) to see whether they can satisfy the requirements of your specific program.

## Arts Courses

-   **GART-1500: Effective Writing I** - this class is easy if you feel comfortable with writing and grammar. There are a lot of independent readings, weekly assignments, quizzes, and paragraph-writing. However, the classes are short (50 minutes per week). Make sure to follow the rubric and talk to your GA/TA whenever you need help!

### Special Notes
-   *All Economics courses will be permitted to satisfy either Science or Social Science requirements.

### Course Tips

-   Bailey recommends taking ECON-1100 online instead of in-person, if available. The class only consists of midterms and final, and the midterms were all online and therefore open book. Read the textbook thoroughly and you will do well. If the professor requires Pearson MyLab, Christine recommends utilizing its flashcards and mastery questions as study guides.

## CS electives

Although no Computer Science courses can be used to satisfy your Arts/Languages/Social Science requirements, you might want to take some easy classes alongside your hard major classes. Here are some recommendations:

-   **COMP-2067: Programming for Beginners** - Steven says this is a super easy course. Teaches you bare basics of Python (think COMP-1400 but easier and Python).
-   **COMP-2057: Intro to the Internet** - Simple HTML/CSS assignments.
-   **COMP-2097: Social Media and Mobile Technology for End Users** - A bit busy with assignments/projects but still overall very easy
-   **COMP-2707: Advanced Website Design** - Easy exams, covers HTML, CSS, a bit of Javascript but a lot of work with assignments/projects

Many of these classes also have a distance education option (as of 2022), so they can help you make your timetable more flexible.
