Other student organizations, too, may have their own list of student awards (OPUS scholarships and awards are included in the above lists of awards).

Although these awards are not specific to Computer Science students, we highly encourage you to apply to any awards that you are eligible for. As well, there are many other awards in the UWinAward Profile that you can apply for. Look for them using the [award search][awardsearch] portal.

## External Awards and Financial Aid Opportunities

Throughout the academic year, there may also be events that offer ballot draws where the winning current or entering students can receive free tuition up to a certain amount.

Additionally, here are a few scholarship websites that offer external scholarship, as suggested by the Student Awards & Financial Aid Office:

-   www.scholarshipscanada.com
-   www.yconic.com

The Student Success and Leadership Center also has a list of [external awards](https://www.uwindsor.ca/success/externalawards) for application.

Many employers also offer scholarship or award opportunities for their employees, so make sure to check if you or your relatives' employers have such offers. Community organizations are also a good place to look for award opportunities, especially if you have been involved in their programs through volunteering or other positions.
