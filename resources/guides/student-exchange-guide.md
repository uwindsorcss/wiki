Jose thinks exchanges are fun and 100% worth it. The Exchange Coordinator, Michelle, is a fantastic and knowledgable person and can help you with any concerns/questions. You can hear about Jose's experience here:

In addition, you can also watch this series of UWindsor video clarifying some information about Student Exchange, or you can contact [Michelle Bondy](mailto:exchange@uwindsor.ca).

## Eligibility Requirement

When you apply to go on a student exchange, the following requirements are considered. These requirements aren't set in stone, however, and you _may_ still be considered during special circumstances or if you can satisfy the requirements in some other way.

-   Be enrolled in a UWindsor degree program during the exchange.
-   Have a cumulative average of 72%+ at the time of application.
-   Be in good academic standing.
-   Have completed two years (~20 courses) worth of University-level education before exchange.
-   Proficiency in second language (when the host institution does not teach in English).

In addition, you must follow these [exchange policies](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentexchange/418/student-exchange-policy) as CS students:

-   You can only exchange for up to one academic year per degree program.
-   You must have a full course load (as defined by the host institution) during the exchange.
-   You will not normally be eligible for refund of tuition if you withdraw from exchange before completing the current semester.
-   If you took classes recognized for credit by the host institution for their students, then these classes will be recognized for credit by UWindsor. The opposite also applies.
-   Your grades in these courses will be transformed into UWindsor grades.

## Exchange Destinations

Students in Computer Science programs can go to different destinations of exchange depending on the program/host institution applied for. Usually, each program/host institution has only 1-4 spots for exchange. This number of spaces, however, can change depending on the agreements made between the University of Windsor and the host institution. Since not all spaces are available every year or every semester, it is strongly recommended that you check the [Destination by Major](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentexchange/388/destinations-major) and [Current Available Destinations](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentexchange/424/currently-available-2) before you apply for your destination of choice.

Depending on the host institution, you may be required to prove proficiency in the language that the institution teaches in. As for now, the following destinations available to CS students teach in a language other than English:

-   France
-   Germany
-   Italy
-   Mexico

In such scenario, you may need to take a language assessment with the Languages department as arranged by the [Exchange Office](mailto:exchange@uwindsor.ca).

## Exchange Expenses

Here are some expenses that you should consider before going on an exchange:

-   Tuition and ancillary fees
    -   UWindsor students will continue to pay their normal UWindsor tuition and ancillary fees, and no tuition/application fees are charged by the host institution.
    -   Student association fees, however, are waived.
    -   UWSA supplementary health insurance are charged, but students can still opt-out.
-   Travel and accommodation/living costs
    -   These costs will also include costs for visa, passport and other travel documents.
    -   The host institution can help students find accommodations, generally in the forms of student residence and meal plans.
-   Insurance
    -   Students must purchase health insurance, in addition to OHIP, appropriate for the country of destination.
    -   The host institution may provide this insurance for students to purchase.

The University of Windsor has a page detailing some of the [financial assistance](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentexchange/310/financial-assistance) you can receive for exchange. Students can also apply to the University of Windsor International Mobility Award. In addition, the Government of [Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/education/bank-student-loan.html) and [Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/study-abroad#section-2) has programs to provide financial aid for students studying abroad.

Sometimes, your country of destination may also provide financial aid programs for students studying in their country. If your country of destination allows international students to do part-time work, you may also [work during exchange](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentexchange/417/working-while-exchange) to cover a part of your expenses.

## Application Process

Students interested in applying must have these components in their application:

-   [Exchange Online Application](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentexchange/421/online-application)
-   **Three** [Reference Letters/Forms](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentexchange/306/reference-forms)
    -   The form must be completed and returned by the references, not the student.
    -   One of the three references must be a UWindsor faculty member who has taught the student in a class.
-   [Language Assessment](https://www.uwindsor.ca/studentexchange/307/language-preparation) (if applicable)

After applying, you may be interviewed by the Exchange Office to determine your interest in the exchange program. The Exchange Office has a selection committee who will review the applications, interview the applicants, and rank candidates based on the following criteria:

-   Seriousness of interest
    -   This can be demonstrated in the depth of research you showcase about the school(s) you applied for.
-   Suitability of the host institution’s program for degree requirements
-   Ability to be a good ambassador and representative of the University and the city while away
-   Interesting classes you noted when making your application for exchange
    -   You are not expected to make a class schedule when applying for exchange, but this is a nice bonus point.
-   Personal adaptability
-   Participation in university and community life
-   Academic ability

The interview may be conducted in a second language if the school(s) you applied for does not teach in English. In addition, the interview is a great opportunity for you to ask some questions you have about the exchange.

### Important Deadline

:::important

You should send in your complete application (including the language assessment and reference forms to be sent by the references) **before** the specified deadline to get priority when considered for exchange placements. Although late applications are still accepted, late applicants are only considered when there is remaining space and time.

:::

-   **January 15th (before 3 pm)** - application deadline for students beginning exchange in September (1 or 2 semesters)
    -   Applications are usually available around mid-October.
-   **September 15th (before 3 pm)** - application deadline for students beginning exchange in January (1 semester)
    -   Applications are usually available around late June.

Generally, students are recommended to apply during their second year and begin exchange during their third year to allow for flexibility in course selection when studying abroad. To ensure that your graduation is not delayed, you should consult with your academic department/advisor about the interest you have for the exchange program.

:::note

Students going on exchange in their final semester may have their convocation delayed due to the time needed to process transfer credits.
