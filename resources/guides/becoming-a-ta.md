## How to become a TA?

To become a TA a student _typically_ needs to have completed their first year of courses. 

The processes will **usually** begin a few months before the start of the next term:

| Term   | TA Process Begins | Staring Month |
|:------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|
| Winter | October           | January       |
| Spring | March             | May           |
| Fall   | July              | September     |

The processes starts with an email from the department explaining which courses will require TA positions and how many positions are available. This email will cover which courses will have positions available and basic information about the positions like:

- All courses and labs will be on campus (including some Distance Education courses that may require on campus office hours)
- All GA/TA employees must make themselves available, and must be available for all assigned duties, both on-campus and online as required
- Each GA position is expected to be for a total of 140 hours. A limited number of GA positions may be available for fewer hours
- The total number of hours of a TA appointment will depend on the number of applications received and is anticipated to be 75-100 hours per position.  Note that Teaching Assistants can be employed for no more than 100 TA hours per semester total


Once confirming that you meet the basic requirements for eligibility:

- Successful completion of the course (80% minimum average) or demonstrated experience/knowledge in subject matter (which will be determined by interview) 
- Must have a minimum cumulative average of 75%. Must have a minimum major average of 80%

- Must be familiar with Brightspace and MS Teams or be able to acquire knowledge through training 
- Remote internet access requirements: Must have access to a computer with a reliable internet connection with video and audio capabilities
    
Or reviewing to see if you meet the preferred requirements:

- Preferred qualifications will only be considered if there are 2 or more applicants who meet the required essential qualifications and who are relatively equal based on the criteria as per articles 12:03 or 12:04 of the CUPE 4580 collective agreement
- Preference for TA positions will be given to applicants registered in a Computer Science program
- Completion of CTL GA/TA Academy workshop (s) is an asset
- Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) Brightspace Training completed

You can begin the process by visiting the [School of Computer Science Online GA/TA Application website](https://forms.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/modules/form_builder/published/ta_ga_application.php) [2]

There are 5 pages to fill out, including your contact information, previous experiences, and top 10 courses ranked in order of your preferred placement.

Once the form is submitted, if a successful candidate you will hear back from the University with an offer letter _typically_ 1-4 weeks before classes begin.

One important thing to note is the University has the right to change your position if needed. This means if you are offered to TA for one course and sign the contract, they could simply send you an email saying you have been reassigned to another course instead.

To accept a TA position there are a few steps involved:

1. Reply to the email offer with a message accepting the offer
    * E.g. "I accept this offer and confirm that I will be available to report for in-person duties in F/W/S term 20XX."
2. Confirm you are enrolled in at least one course (This could even be a Coop course)
3. [Digitally sign the contract](https://www.uwindsor.ca/graduate-studies/1236/adding-digital-signature-pdf-fillable-form) [3]
4. Complete the HR hiring package
    * This will include signing multiple forms for the University's records like an offer letter, duties check list, Ontario Taxes form (TD1ON), Canadian Taxes form (TD1), and possibly more
    * Some forms will ask for an employee number, if this is your first time working for the University leave this blank and they will provide you with one on a later date. If you have an employee number but do not remember it, look at your employee profile on the [University of Windsor Employee Site](https://myuwinfo.uwindsor.ca/default) [4]
5. Ping a Mod in the CSS Discord to give you the TA Role! 
    * This role will help students recognize you as a TA, giving you another space to help students
    * It could also assist you as a way to contact other TAs in case you have a further question about the process, or responsibilities involved

Once you submit all of your paper work you must wait for confirmation from HR before beginning any work as a TA. You can communicate and meet with the instructor, however not begin any work until this confirmation is received. 

## TA Resources

Once accepting a TA position there are [training courses](https://ctl2.uwindsor.ca/workshops/) [5] that are offered by the University that you can take to help you during your term. Some training courses are required, others optional. Most are one time only, meaning the next time you are a TA, you will not be required to do them again.

You can also log into your [University of Windsor Employee Site](https://myuwinfo.uwindsor.ca/default) [4] to see you payment information, completed trainings, T4, and other information.
